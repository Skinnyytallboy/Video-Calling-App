<h2>How to run this program</h2><br>
So this program contains two files, one is "main" and the other one is named as "Second". Inorder to run this program, run these two programs on different devices, but both on the same internet network, and then you can test/run the program.

<h3>
  How I made this project?
</h3>
<br>
I used python language for this project as socket programming is easier on python than on any other language like c++,etc. (In my opinion). While setting up the socket programming, i used TCP over UDP, although UDP is better for these types of applications but i was't able to make it successful over UDP as i failed on fullfilling the needs for it. Also because TCP provides alot of facilities. After that, i used opencv in python inorder to capture screen and video camera, and used pyaudio for audio transmission. Then I used tkinter for graphics.
